## What is this POC for?

* To understand how sharp stream APIs work in terms of processing JPEG images.

* To verify if use of stream can be more efficient than buffers

* To address [the memory issues in sharp caused by buffers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58066655/nodejs-sharp-node-package-memory-consumption-issue)

* To provide code base for [this stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58474891/sharp-duplex-stream-emits-chunks-larger-than-65536)
